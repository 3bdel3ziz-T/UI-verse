# UI-verse
This repo is consisting of my art work on UI-verse website and more components that website doesn't agree on it with unknown reason all based on HTML & CSS (with SCSS file that compiled from) or HTML & Tailwindcss.

# why i created this repo ?
UI-verse website doesn't allow SACC/SCSS style sheets just allows CSS or Tailwind classes,

# what will you find in this repo ?
You will find buttons, animations as (hover, focus, check, active and else...), forms, checkboxes, input fields and custom shapes.

### Important note.
the normalize file is important to has the same shape as you see,
because it resets browser styles and centering the parent element.
