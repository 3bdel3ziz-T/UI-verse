# UI-verse
This repo is consisting of my art work on UI-verse website and more components that website doesn't agree on it with unknown reason all based on HTML & CSS (compiled from scss without prefixes) or HTML & Tailwindcss.

# why i created this repo ?
UI-verse website doesn't allow SACC/SCSS style sheets just allows CSS or Tailwind classes.

# what will you find in this repo ?
You will find buttons, animations as (hover, focus, check, ...), forms, checkboxes, input fields and custom shapes.

###Important note.
